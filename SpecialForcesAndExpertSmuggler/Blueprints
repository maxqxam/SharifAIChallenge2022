Thief brain : Expert Smuggler
    Never steps inside the territory of a cop
    When no cop is chasing him, he checks if he can move to a better node 
    (better means a more flexible node, a node with more adjacent nodes )
    If a better move is not detected, he stays where he is

Cop brain : Special Forces
    Sets his the first visible enemy thief as his target, 
    chooses one of the nodes in that thief territory indexed by his rank in his team.
    (Meaning if the node of a thief has 5 adjacent nodes, the special forces will populate all of them , without communicating)
    When he seeis no thieves, he moves towards a better node only if it's a better node

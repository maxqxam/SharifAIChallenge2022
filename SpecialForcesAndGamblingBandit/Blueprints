Thief brain : Gambling Bandit
    Never steps inside the territory of a cop
    When no cop is chasing him, he checks if he can move to a better node 
    (better means a more flexible node, a node with more adjacent nodes )
    If a better move is not detected, he stays where he is
    When he is not in danger, checks if he resides in the same node as another ally thief,
    if so, he'll reduce he's precision in order to stay away from him.
    Also when he is not in danger he never moves to places that are in the territory of 
    an Ally thief

Cop brain : Special Forces
    Sets his the first visible enemy thief as his target, 
    chooses one of the nodes in that thief territory indexed by his rank in his team.
    (Meaning if the node of a thief has 5 adjacent nodes, the special forces will populate all of them , without communicating)
    When he seeis no thieves, he moves towards a better node only if it's a better node

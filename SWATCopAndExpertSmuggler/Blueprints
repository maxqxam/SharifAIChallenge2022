Thief brain : Slippery Thief
    Never steps inside the territory of a cop
    When no cop is chasing him, he checks if he can move to a better node 
    (better means a more flexible node, a node with more adjacent nodes )
    If a better move is not detected, he stays where he is

Cop brain : SWAT Cop
    moves towards the last location of the thief with the smallest ID
    When he seeis no thieves, he moves towards a good node

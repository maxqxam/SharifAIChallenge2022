Thief brain : Expert Smuggler
    Never steps inside the territory of a cop
    When no cop is chasing him, he checks if he can move to a better node
    (better means a more flexible node, a node with more adjacent nodes )
    If a better move is not detected, he stays where he is

Cop brain : Robo cop Squad
    It's almost the same as special forces , but it has an extended unity.

    He's strategy is :
        Patrol - When they have no vision
        Approach - Same as before, but they don't overstep their destinations
        Find pin   - Detects pins in the current situation, and keeps them in that case.
        Catch - If multiple cops can catch a thief, only one of them does

Thief brain : Serial killer
    Never steps inside the territory of a cop
    When no cop is chasing him, he checks if he can move to a better node
    (better means a more flexible node, a node with more adjacent nodes )
    If a better move is not detected, he stays where he is

    When a thief is surrounded, you can slip through the surrounding circle if the next move is not isVisible!
    Make sure to escape to nodes that do not make you surrounded or pinned!

Cop brain : Robo cop Squad
    It's almost the same as special forces , but it has an extended unity.

    He's strategy is :
        Patrol - When they have no vision
        Approach - Same as before, but they don't overstep their destinations
        Find pin   - Detects pins in the current situation, and keeps them in that case.
        Catch - If multiple cops can catch a thief, only one of them does
